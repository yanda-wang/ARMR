# ARMR

# Overview
This repository consists of the implement of the ARMR model. ARMR firstly models temporal information from medical records to obtain patient representations, and builds a key-value memory network based on information from historical admissions. Then ARMR carries out multi-hop reading on the memory network to recommend medications. Meanwhile, ARMR uses a GAN model to adversarially regulate the distribution of patient representations by matching the distribution to a desired Gaussian distribution to achieve DDI reduction.

# Requirement
Pytorch 1.1

Python 3.7

# Data
Experiments are carried out based on [MIMIC-III](https://mimic.physionet.org)ï¼Œ which is a real-world Electoric Healthcare Records (EHRs) dataset, and it collects clinical information related to over 45,000 patients. The diagnoses and procedures are used as inputs of ARMR, and the medications prescribed in the first 24 hours of each admission are selected out as ground truths.

Patient records are firstly selected out from the raw data into a file, and each line contains the information for a single admission in the form of \[subject_id, hadm_id, admittime, medications, diagnoses, procedures\].You could find an example below.

\[17, 194023, 2134-12-27 07:15:00, A12A; C01C; B05C; N07A; A12C; A07A; N01A; C02D; M01A; A10A, 2724; 45829; 7455; V1259, 3571; 3961; 8872\]

After constructing the vocabulary for medical concepts, i.e., assigning a identical integer to each medical concepts, medications, diagnoses, and procedures are represented by corresponding integers, and patient records are transformed into a np.array, while each element in the array represents information for a single patient in the form \[adm_1, adm_2, ..., adm_n\]. For each adm_i, the form is \[\[med_1, med_2, ..., med_m\],\[diag_1, diag_2, ..., dig_d\],\[pro_1, pro_2, ..., pro_p\],\[ddi rate\]]. For instance, we could find an example below, and there are two admissions in the example. For the first admission, the medications are 3, 4, and 5, the diagnoses are 6 and 7, the procedures are 8 and 9, and the ddi rate is 0.3.

\[\[\[3, 4, 5\], \[6, 7\], \[8, 9\], \[0.3\]\], \[\[10 ,11\], \[12, 13, 14\], \[15, 16\], \[0.2\]\]\]
